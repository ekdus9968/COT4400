# COT4400
COT4400::Analysis of Algorithms

# University Course Description
This course emphasizes the computational complexity of a problem, the efficiency of an algorithm for solving a problem, techniques for designing algorithms, and the inherent intractability of certain problems. Skills that the student will take away from this course include: (1) determining whether a problem is NP-complete, (2) analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm, and (3) applying techniques for designing efficient algorithms.

# Course Prerequisites
